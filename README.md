# Personal and academic projects
In this section, I highlight the projects in which I had practical experience in the tools I intend to use in my career and systems that development required the application 
of engineering methods learned during my undergraduate. Among the smaller projects, I highlight: 

- [Resta Um](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/restaum): Algorithm for resolution of generic peg solitaire game using C.
- [Web Server](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/servidor-web): Simple Web Server using Python Socket Programming
- [Organize.se](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/organizese): Platform for tasks management. Final project of the CS50 course.

## [Smart Cam](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF79YRvrBc/8r4vmDkX1FXDvOye1nYRnA/edit)
A dynamically positioned smart camera that points towards sound noise occurrences that exceed an intensity threshold.
With Smart Cam, you can control the camera manually or let it react to the environment's sounds. The recording is always available online at any time.

### Key Learnings
- Digital Circuit implementation in FPGA using VHDL
- Arduino Integration with FPGA
- Web Streaming through internet using ESP32-CAM
- Usage of sensor modules and servo motors

## [Twin Genious - Genius Game Digital Twin](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxDvowMMk/fmFql6FsF3cnarBq7WEV1A/edit?utm_content=DAFxDvowMMk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
  This project offers a new experience for the classical Genius game.
Using a web interface, you can control a digital circuit fully implemented in FPGA that contains the game's logic. The game has two play modes and includes sound feedback using an FPGA-controlled circuit.
  Check the project's source code [here](https://github.com/GARSoftPoli/twin-genious).

  ### Key Learnings
  - Digital Circuit implementation in FPGA using VHDL
  - MQTT messages handling with ESP32
  - Hardware-Software integration
  - Cloud broker provisioning using HiveMQ

  ## [Ice cream shop management system](https://github.com/004-JPA/FranquiaSorveteria) 
  Rest API for ice cream shop analytics.
  
  ### Key Learnings
  - Analytical SQL query development
  - Entity-Relationship diagram creation
  - Endpoints construction with Spring
  - MySQL database and tables creation
  
## [Super Gerenciador Musical](https://github.com/projetomac0321/SuperGerenciadorMusical)
  Fullstack project for user interaction with Spotify playlists ecosystem.  
  
  ### Key learnings
  - OAuth 2.0 Authentication within Spotify API
  - REST API development with Spring
