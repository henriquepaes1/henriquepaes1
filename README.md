# Personal and academic projects
In this section, I highlight the projects in which I had practical experience in the tools I intend to use in my career and systems that development required the application 
of engineering methods learned during my undergraduate. Among the smaller projects, I highlight: 

- [Resta Um](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/restaum): Algorithm for resolution of generic peg solitaire game using C.
- [Web Server](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/servidor-web): Simple Web Server using Python Socket Programming
- [Organize.se](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/organizese): Platform for tasks management. Final project of the CS50 course.

## [Smart Cam](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF79YRvrBc/8r4vmDkX1FXDvOye1nYRnA/edit)
This project, presented as the final project of the Digital Laboratory II discipline consists of a smart camera that points towards sound noises that exceed a pre-defined limit.
The idea behind this project is to build a camera that doesn't have a static position (such as the majority of the cameras in the market), in a way that it could point towards an occurrence that produces high noise, 
such as a car crash.
Using Smart Cam, you can either control the camera manually or let it react to the environment sounds. The recording is always available online at any time.

### Key Learnings
- Digital Circuit implementation in FPGA using VHDL
- Arduino Integration with FPGA
- Web Streaming through internet

### Tools
- Arduino
- VHDL
- ESP32-CAM
- FPGA
- Servo Motors
- KY-038 sensor modules

## [Twin Genious - Genius Game Digital Twin](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxDvowMMk/fmFql6FsF3cnarBq7WEV1A/edit?utm_content=DAFxDvowMMk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
  This project, presented as the final project of the Digital Laboratory I discipline, brings a new experience for the classical Genius game.
  Using a web interface, you can control a digital circuit fully implemented in FPGA that contains the game's logic. The game has two different play modes and includes sound feedback using  a circuit also controlled by an FPGA.
  Check the project's source code [here](https://github.com/GARSoftPoli/twin-genious).
