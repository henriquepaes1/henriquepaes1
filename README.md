# Personal and academic projects
In this section, I highlight the projects in which I had practical experience in the tools I intend to use in my career and systems that development required the application 
of engineering methods learned during my undergraduate. Among the smaller projects, I highlight: 

- [Resta Um](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/restaum): Algorithm for resolution of generic peg solitaire game using C.
- [Organize.se](https://github.com/henriquepaes1/organizese): Platform for tasks management. Final project of the CS50 course.

## [Twin Genious - Genius Game Digital Twin](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxDvowMMk/fmFql6FsF3cnarBq7WEV1A/edit?utm_content=DAFxDvowMMk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
  This project, presented as the final project of the Digital Laboratory I discipline, brings a new experience for the classical Genius game.
  Using a web interface, you can control a digital circuit fully implemented in FPGA that contains the game's logic. The game has two different play modes and includes sound feedback using  a circuit also controlled by an FPGA.
  Check the project's source code [here](https://github.com/GARSoftPoli/twin-genious).
